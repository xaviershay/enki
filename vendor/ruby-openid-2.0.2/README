==Installing
Before running the examples or writing your own code you'll need to install
the library.  See the INSTALL file or use rubygems:

  gem install ruby-openid
  
Check the installation:
  
  $ irb
  irb> require 'rubygems'
  irb> require_gem 'ruby-openid'
  => true

The library is known to work with Ruby 1.8.4 on Unix, Max OSX and

==Getting Started with OpenID::Consumer
OpenID::Consumer is the place to start if you'd like to support OpenID
authentication on your website.  The examples directory contains
several working examples to help you get started, and the
OpenID::Consumer class is well-documented.

Also, check out the OpenIDLoginGenerator!  Read examples/README for
more info.

==Serving OpenID with OpenID::Server
The examples directory contains a fully-functional OpenID server that
uses the Ruby on Rails framework.  Start by reading about the
OpenID::Server interface documentation and looking at the example.
