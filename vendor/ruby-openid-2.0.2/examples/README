This directory contains several examples that demonstrate use of the
OpenID library.  Make sure you have properly installed the library
before running the examples.  These examples are a great place to
start in integrating OpenID into your application.

==Rails example

The rails_openid contains a fully functional OpenID server and relying
party, and acts as a starting point for implementing your own
production rails server.  You'll need the latest version of Ruby on
Rails installed, and then:

 cd rails_openid
 ./script/server

Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000/ and follow the instructions.


==Rails OpenidLoginGenerator

A port of the standard LoginGenerator OpenID authentication instead of
passwords.  Use this generator as a *starting point* for your OpenID
enabled rails app.

You can read about LoginGenerator at
http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/LoginGenerator

===Running the generator

* Copy the contents of rails_openid_login_generator into 
 ~/.rails/generators/openid_login 
 (or symlink: ln -s examples/rails_openid_login_generator 
                    ~/.rails/generators/openid_login)
* run script/generate openid_login openid

You will now have an openid_controller.rb in app/controllers. You'll
need to create your 'users' database table before running the
application.  For schemas and more details about this generator, read
README_LOGIN in you rails root directory.

==Rails ActiveRecord OpenIDStore plugin

For various reasons you may want or need to deploy your ruby openid
consumer/server using an SQL based store.  The active_record_openid_store 
is a plugin that makes using an SQL based store simple.  Follow the
README inside the plugin's dir for usage.
